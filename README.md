# Braeside Smart Mart E-Commerce Website

Braeside Smart Mart is your one-stop shop where you can buy all the products available at Braeside online, just like you would in-store.

Details:

*	Advised the school on the issue that they didn’t have an online E-Commerce alternative for their shop, and proposed my version of a potential solution using React, Node.js and MongoDB.
*	Designed an interactive and visually appealing home page, alongside separate pages for item categories and individual items.
*	Stored records of products and users on MongoDB and linked it to the website allowing for successful sign-up, login, and user session recovery.
*	Created a functional admin panel where products can be added and removed and automatically updated on the website.
*	Made mock payment system and shopping cart functionality.
*	As a result, the school’s version of a solution was created and rolled out for use soon after.
